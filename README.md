# jira-runner

JIRA Runner is a simple node module that wraps a node JIRA client (https://github.com/steves/node-jira).  The wrapper exposes only the read operation and currently only supports executing JQL queries.  

You will need provide Zonar URL, user name and password in settings.js.

To install, "npm install".
